execute-other-window.el provides a command to switch to the next window, run a
command, then switch back to the original window automatically. Use it to save
keystrokes when you need to do just one thing in the other window, like scroll
the buffer, jump to a definition, paste some text, or quit a temporary buffer.
It is a sort of generalization of the built-in commands `scroll-other-window'
and `scroll-other-window-down'. For a full description and setup instructions,
see the Commentary section in execute-other-window.el.
