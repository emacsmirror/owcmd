owcmd.el provides a command to switch to the next window, run a command, then
switch back to the original window automatically. Use it to save keystrokes when
you need to do just one thing in the other window, like scroll the buffer, jump
to a definition, paste some text, or quit a temporary buffer.  It is a sort of
generalization of the built-in commands `scroll-other-window' and
`scroll-other-window-down'. For a full description and setup instructions, see
the Commentary section in owcmd.el.
